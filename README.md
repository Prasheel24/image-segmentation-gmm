## Description
This project deals with the detection of underwater buoys of different colors using EM algorithm

## Dependencies
* Ubuntu 16
* Python 3.7
* OpenCV 4.2
* Numpy
* matplotlib
* sys
* math


## Run
To run the code for detecting all buoys using 3D gaussian
```
python3.7 model_all_colors_3D.py
```
Enter the choice of code (histogram, training or detection of buoys) when prompted

To run the code for 1D detection of yellow buoy
